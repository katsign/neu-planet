### This microblog web app started as a bootcamp exercise and grew into a larger collaborative project, [devlr](https://devlr.herokuapp.com). I went back and restyled this initial starting point of the project for personal use.

## *Description*
neuPlanet is a personal microblogging platform for the late stage internet user â€” sometimes you just need to post into the void. This application uses Express to serve static files in a dynamic way and sources data using a Sequelize ORM and MySQL database.

## *Installation*
### Open the repository folder in your prefered code editor and pull up the built-in terminal. You will need Node.js installed to run this application.
- Type `npm i` to pull the project dependencies to your local.
- Navigate to the `/config` folder and update the MySQL connection information to match your own Workbench instance.

## *Usage*
### This app is not deployed, as it's currently designed for personal use on a local server. Clone the repo to start editing.
- To start the development server, type `npm start` in your terminal.
- To add a new post to the database, click into `username` and enter your posting alias.
- Then, enter your post body (255 char limit) in `What's on your mind?` and click `Post`.
- Delete entries by clicking the trash icon.
